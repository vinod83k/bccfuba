                    <p>Set up in 1985 for the manufacture of professional grade PCBs, BCC Fuba India Limited was 
                        one of the early entrants in the Indian PCB market. It took root as a joint-venture 
                        collaboration with Fuba Hans Kolbe & Co., Germany, a company having the fine 
                        distinction of being the largest PCB manufacturer in Europe, along with DEG, Germany, 
                        a well-known European financial institution. Accordingly, the facility was set up and 
                        developed with the most high-tech machinery imported from Germany, Italy, France, the UK 
                        and the USA. Further, the company was infused with a powerful impetus-package that combines 
                        the world’s best technological inputs with the complete manufacturing and quality control 
                        processes and skills, including certain special methods innovated and known only to Fuba 
                        Hans Kolbe & Co till date. To this, we have constantly made advancements keeping in mind
